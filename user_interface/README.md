CASE STUDY
1.ANALYZE AND REPORT
     In the analysis and conclusion of the case study, I chose  Flutter for the user interface to ensure better performance  and  compatibility on both  iOS and Android operating systems. I designed the user interface using Flutter in Android Studio, and utilized Dart language for the design . I could have chosen a Swift interface for the iOS operating system, but I did  not have access to an iOS device.
     
1.1.	Analyze
     In the analysis section, I will analyze the existing three pages separately.
Navigation Bar: I designed the navigation bar to be fixed. When the variables on the bar are pressed, the color of the variables changes . As the user interface is developed, new pages can be designed to enable transitions. The images of the varaibles on the bar can be enhanced with better packaged and more attractive visuals. Since I couldn’t work with Flutter icons, I wasn’t able to create optimal visual designs.

1.2.	Report
Pages::  The design pages rotate in the “body” section of the user interface. During this process, I used rows, columns, and containers to  create the necessary designs.

1.2.1.	Accept the terms page  ( first page )
     On the first page, the user cannot proceed to the next page unless they accept the two required terms. Once the user checks the required checkboxes and presses the “Accept  the Terms” button, they proceed to the second page. The shape  changes when the close icon is pressed. I wanted tos how that it works and is activated.

1.2.2.	Take a selfie page  ( second page )
    On the second page, the necessary instructions for taking a selfie are provided. Flutter does not have the same icons available for this purpose. I believe I have added better icons for the instructions here. The user proceeds to the third page by pressing the “Take a Selfie” button.

1.2.3.	Permission  Page ( third page )
     This page had a link for granting camera permissions. I  designed “Cancel” and “Allow” buttons and made them clickable. I could not complete the camera activation during the permission process, but I will add it later.
